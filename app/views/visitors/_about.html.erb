            <h3>Founding</h3>
            <p>In 2012 Watan began operating as a framework for various organizations and groups, some of which had started operations
              in 2006. Watan operates within social and developmental circles, striving to be a non-political umbrella for young activists
              to gather under.</p>

            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>We strive to develop individuals and society through a group of civil society institutions run by specialized personnel.
              We aim to establish our presence throughout Syria, in all its provinces, and wherever Syrian communities exist. We focus on
              nation building and developmental projects.</p>

            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>To be recognized as the pioneer of Syrian national development, in order to help build the Syria of the future.</p>
